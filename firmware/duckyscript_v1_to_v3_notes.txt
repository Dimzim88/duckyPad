updated mostly to match syntax, not totally compatible because many new commands are for hacking and payload injection, which is not the focus of duckypad.

added STRINGLN command, equivalent to STRING then ENTER
ADDED INJECT_MOD command, optional since modifier keys already work on its own
changed KEYDOWN and KEYUP to HOLD and RELEASE
renamed old HOLD to OLD_HOLD, still need to come up with a new name
removed DEFAULT_DELAY command
