# UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!!!!1 COMING SOON!!!!!!!!!!

Welcome to **duckyScript 3** beta test!

DS3 was released by [Hak5](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/) in late 2022, with new features and improved capabilities.

Major work had to be done to port it to duckyPad, but I'm glad to announce it's (mostly) finished!

## What's New

duckyScript 3 now behaves a lot more like a **general-purpose language**, with:

* Variables

* Conditional Statements

* Loops 

* Functions

* Math & Logical Operators

As a result, you can now write much more elaborate scripts for your automation needs!

-----

* DS3 is now compiled into **Bytecode** and executed on a **virtual machine**, resulting in **much faster** performance!

* **New commands** for **printing to OLED screen** and **reading button status**

* **Backwards compatible** with existing scripts (or at least should!)

* More detailed code check error reports

* General cleanup and bug fixes

## Limitations
