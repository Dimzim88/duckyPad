Welcome to **duckyScript 3** beta test!

DS3 was released by [Hak5](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/) in late 2022, with new features and improved capabilities.

Major work was done to implement it on duckyPad, but I'm glad to announce it's (mostly) finished!

## What's New

duckyScript 3 now behaves a lot more like a **general-purpose language**, with:

* Variables

* Conditional Statements

* Loops 

* Functions

* Math & Logical Operators

As a result, you can now write much more elaborate scripts for your automation needs!

-----

* DS3 is now also compiled into **Bytecode** and executed on a **virtual machine**, resulting in **much faster** performance!

* **New commands** for **printing to OLED screen** and **reading button status**

* **Backwards compatible** with existing scripts (or at least should!)

* More detailed code check error reports

* General cleanup and bug fixes

## Limitations

### Bugs!

This is a huge update, so expect bugs, especially at this stage.

If you run into any, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dekuNukem/duckypad/issues), ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4sJCBx5), or email `dekuNukem`@`gmail`.`com` @

### Bytecode Compiler

With DS3 now very much a general-purpose language, it takes a lot more work to process it properly. Examples include expression evaluation via abstract syntax tree (AST), flow control with jump tables, arithmetic and call stacks, and more. 

This is much too complicated to do on-device, therefore, DS3 is now compiled into bytecode, and executed on a virtual stack machine.

Good news is the configurator takes care of everything for you, so it's business as usual.

However, if you want to manually edit the SD card, it is now a bit more involved, since you'll need to compile the script and copy over the binary too.

See below for instructions, and in the meantime I'll try to support the old firmware version in the foreseeable future.
